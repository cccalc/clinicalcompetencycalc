# Clinical Competency Calculator

![CCC Logo](doc/images/github_banner.jpg)

## About The Project

The CCC is a grading tool to be used to assess the competencies of students undergoing clerkship at Hershey Medical Center.
The CCC aims to replace and improve upon the preexisting method of collecting feedback from raters by aggregating more useful feedback and providing more insightful analyses.
Via this system, students and administrators will have the ability to review student performance as reported by raters.
Administrators will also be able to filter low-quality feedback.
All of these options will be implemented to allow students, raters, and administrators to access them via any device that has a modern web browser, such as smartphones, laptops, and desktop computers.
