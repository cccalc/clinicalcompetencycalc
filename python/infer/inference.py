  You are a clinician evaluating the performance of a student undergoing a clinical clerkship. The student has been observed and graded based on the AAMC's Core Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs), of which there are 13. The student is graded on each key function, which comprises the EPAs. Here are the key functions:

  1.1: Obtain a complete and accurate history in an organized fashion
  1.2: Demonstrate patient-centered interview skills
  1.3: Demonstrate clinical reasoning in gathering focused information relevant to a patient's care
  1.4: Perform a clinically relevant, appropriately thorough physical exam pertinent to the setting and purpose of the patient visit

  2.1: Synthesize essential information from previous records, history, physical exam, and initial diagnostic evaluations to propose a scientifically supported differential diagnosis
  2.2: Prioritize and continue to integrate information as it emerges to update differential diagnosis, while managing ambiguity
  2.3: Engage and communicate with team members for endorsement and verification of the working diagnosis that will inform management plans

  3.1: Recommend first-line cost-effective screening and diagnostic tests for routine health maintenance and common disorders
  3.2: Provide rationale for decision to order tests, taking into account pre- and posttest probability and patient preference
  3.3: Interpret results of basic studies and understand the implication and urgency of the results

  4.1: Compose orders efficiently and effectively verbally, on paper, and electronically
  4.2: Demonstrate an understanding of the patient's condition that underpins the provided orders
  4.3: Recognize and avoid errors by attending to patient-specific factors, using resources, and appropriately responding to safety alerts
  4.4: Discuss planned orders and prescriptions with team, patients, and families

  5.1: Prioritize and synthesize information into a cogent narrative for a variety of clinical encounters (e.g., admission, progress, pre- and post-op, and procedure notes; informed consent; discharge summary)
  5.2: Follow documentation requirements to meet regulations and professional expectations
  5.3: Document a problem list, differential diagnosis, and plan supported through clinical reasoning that reflects patient's preferences

  6.1: Present personally gathered and verified information, acknowledging areas of uncertainty
  6.2: Provide an accurate, concise, well-organized oral presentation
  6.3: Adjust the oral presentation to meet the needs of the receiver
  6.4: Demonstrate respect for patient's privacy and autonomy

  7.1: Combine curiosity, objectivity, and scientific reasoning to develop a well-formed, focused, pertinent clinical question (ASK)
  7.2: Demonstrate awareness and skill in using information technology to access accurate and reliable medical information (ACQUIRE)
  7.3: Demonstrate skill in appraising sources, content, and applicability of evidence (APPRAISE)
  7.4: Apply findings to individuals and/or patient panels; communicate findings to the patient and team, reflecting on process and outcomes (ADVISE)

  8.1: Document and update an electronic handover tool and apply this to deliver a structured verbal handover
  8.2: Conduct handover using communication strategies known to minimize threats to transition of care
  8.3: Provide succinct verbal communication conveying illness severity, situational awareness, action planning, and contingency planning
  8.4: Give or elicit feedback about handover communication and ensure closed-loop communication
  8.5: Demonstrate respect for patient's privacy and confidentiality

  9.1: Identify team members' roles and responsibilities and seek help from other members of the team to optimize health care delivery
  9.2: Include team members, listen attentively, and adjust communication content and style to align with team-member needs
  9.3: Establish and maintain a climate of mutual respect, dignity, integrity, and trust // Prioritize team needs over personal needs to optimize delivery of care // Help team members in need

  10.1: Recognize normal and abnormal vital signs as they relate to patient- and disease-specific factors as potential etiologies of a patient's decompensation
  10.2: Recognize severity of a patient's illness and indications for escalating care and initiate interventions and management
  10.3: Initiate and participate in a code response and apply basic and advanced life support
  10.4: Upon recognition of a patient's deterioration, communicate situation, clarify patient's goals of care, and update family members

  11.1: Describe the key elements of informed consent: indications, contraindications, risks, benefits, alternatives, and potential complications of the intervention
  11.2: Communicate with the patient and family to ensure that they understand the intervention
  11.3: Display an appropriate balance of confidence and skill to put the patient and family at ease, seeking help when needed

  12.1: Demonstrate technical skills required for the procedure
  12.2: Understand and explain the anatomy, physiology, indications, contraindications, risks, benefits, alternatives, and potential complications of the procedure
  12.3: Communicate with the patient and family to ensure they understand pre- and post- procedural activities
  12.4: Demonstrate confidence that puts patients and families at ease

  13.1: Identify and report actual and potential ("near miss") errors in care using system reporting structure (e.g., event reporting systems, chain of command policies)
  13.2: Participate in system improvement activities in the context of rotations or learning experiences (e.g., rapid-cycle change using plan-do-study-act cycles, root cause analyses, morbidity and mortality conference, failure modes and effects analyses, improvement projects)
  13.3: Engage in daily safety habits (e.g., accurate and complete documentation, including allergies and adverse reactions, medicine reconciliation, patient education, universal precautions, hand washing, isolation protocols, falls and other risk assessments, standard prophylaxis, time-outs)
  13.4: Admit one's own errors, reflect on one's contribution, and develop an individual improvement plan

  And here is the performance of the student with development levels associated with each key function: 0 (remedial), 1 (early developing), 2 (developing), and 3 (entrustable).

  {datastr}

  Based on this, please provide a summary/digest of the student's performance in a manner that is easy to understand. Please also suggest some actionable items for the student or clinician in this summary. For example, to increase observation on a specific aspect or activity, or to investigate specific aspects or activities.
