\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}

The purpose of the software requirements document is to create a comprehensive outline of the \gls{ccc} for the development team, project advisors, faculty advisors, stakeholders, and members of the Hershey Medical team that will be maintaining this software.
This outline will describe the functions and high-level requirements of the \gls{ccc}.
The target audience is expected to know technical terminology related to software development.

\section{Scope}

This document specifies the \gls{ccc} as software designed to be used for the appraisal of \glspl{student} undergoing \gls{clerkship} at Hershey Medical, as is to be utilized by the Department of Family Medicine.
The \gls{ccc} will provide a means of collecting feedback from \glspl{rater} on the \glspl{competency} of \glspl{student} and performing useful, actionable analyses thereon.
The \gls{ccc} is not designed to interface with existing Hershey Medical systems or engage in information exchange therewith.
The \gls{ccc} is also not designed for utilization by other departments within Hershey Medical; should this software be used outside of the stated scope, further requirement elicitation should be carried out and relevant issues addressed.

\section{Client information}

The development of the \gls{ccc} is being sponsored by Anthony Dambro (\email{adambro@pennstatehealth.psu.edu}) from the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center Department of Family Medicine.

\section{Users}

Our intended audience for the \gls{ccc} would be the \glspl{student} undergoing \gls{clerkship}, \glspl{rater} providing feedback on \glspl{student}' \glspl{competency}, and \glspl{administrator} of the entire system and its data.

\chapter{Overall description}

\section{Product perspective}

The \gls{ccc} is a grading tool to be used to assess the \glspl{competency} of \glspl{student} undergoing \gls{clerkship}.
The \gls{ccc} aims to replace and improve upon the preexisting method of collecting feedback from \glspl{rater} by aggregating more useful feedback and providing more insightful analyses.
Via this system, \glspl{student} and \glspl{administrator} will have the ability to review student performance as reported by \glspl{rater}.
\Glspl{administrator} will also be able to filter low-quality feedback.
All of these options will be implemented to allow \glspl{student}, \glspl{rater}, and \glspl{administrator} to access them via any device that has a modern web browser, such as smartphones, laptops, and desktop computers.

\section{Product functions}

\subsection{Student functions}

\Glspl{student} must be able to request a specific \gls{rater} to fill out a \gls{feedback form} for themselves.
\Glspl{student} must also be able to view a \gls{full report} of their performance, which displays where they land along the \glspl{epa} and allows the \gls{student} to view specific comments or other relevant feedback that supports the specific assessment.

\subsection{Rater functions}

\Glspl{rater} must be able to fill out new \glspl{feedback form} by accepting requests from \glspl{student}.
% Additionally, they must be able to view past \glspl{feedback form} that they have submitted.

\subsection{Administrator functions}

\Glspl{administrator} must be able to view all \glspl{feedback form} submitted, along with the \gls{rater} who submitted the forms.
\Glspl{administrator} must be able to view the \gls{full report} of any \gls{student}.
\Glspl{administrator} must also be able to audit and reject \glspl{form response} that are of poor quality or otherwise not useful.

\section{User characteristics}

The \glspl{user} of the \gls{ccc} will have a basic sense of computer literacy including minimal keyboard skills and experience interacting with a browser application prior.
No advanced knowledge of computer systems is needed.
A \gls{user} should be able to learn the \gls{user} interface swiftly.
Additionally, \glspl{rater} must have sufficient professional knowledge regarding the questions that are asked in the \gls{feedback form} and \glspl{student} must be able to understand the feedback and analysis given.

\section{Constraints}
Any device with access to a modern web browser should be able to access and run this application assuming that the device has a monitor/screen to view/interact with the \gls{gui}.
An internet connection is required to access the web application.

\section{Assumptions}
The \glspl{student}, \glspl{rater}, and \glspl{administrator} are assumed always to have the correct information to access their respective accounts and the hardware capability to input that information.
It is also assumed that the database being used is or will be heavily adopted and will likely have support in the near future to ensure an up-to-date system.
The application is also assumed to be deployed in an environment with a stable network.

\chapter{Specific requirements}

\section{External interface requirements}

\subsection{User interfaces}

The user interface will be a web application that can be accessed through a modern web browser.

\subsection{Hardware interfaces}

The hardware interface will be any device, such as a computer or equivalent, that is capable of accessing the internet through a modern web browser.

\subsection{Software interfaces}

\subsubsection{User authentication and authorization}

The system must allow user authentication and authorization features to ensure proper access.
The system will interface with the \gls{psu} authentication system for user role validation, which includes password access and two-factor authentication.
\Glspl{user} will only be able to view data and perform functions as permitted by their authorization level.

\subsubsection{Database management system}

The \gls{ccc} must interface with a database management system to store and retrieve data.
The database will be used to store \gls{form response} data, \gls{user} data, and other relevant information.

The database system should be a \gls{rdbms} such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

The database must be able to retain data for a minimum of two (2) years.

\subsubsection{Web application framework}

The main interface of the \gls{ccc} will be a web application.
The web application will be built using a modern web application framework such as React.

\subsubsection{Server}

The server will be responsible for handling requests from the web application and interfacing with the database.
The server will be hosted by Hershey Medical.
