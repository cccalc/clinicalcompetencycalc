Introduction
============
The CCC is a grading tool to be used to assess the competencies of students 
undergoing clerkship. The CCC aims to replace and improve upon the preexisting 
method of collecting feedback from raters by aggregating more useful feedback 
and providing more insightful analyses. Via this system, students and 
administrators will have the ability to review student performance as 
reported by raters. Administrators will also be able to filter low-quality 
feedback. All of these options will be implemented to allow students, raters, 
and administrators to access them via any device that has a modern web browser, 
such as smartphones, laptops, and desktop computers.
