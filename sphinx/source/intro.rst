Introduction
============
The CCC is a grading tool to be used to assess the competencies of students 
undergoing clerkship. The CCC aims to replace and improve upon the preexisting 
method of collecting feedback from raters by aggregating more useful feedback 
and providing more insightful analyses. Via this system, students and 
administrators will have the ability to review student performance as 
reported by raters. Administrators will also be able to filter low-quality 
feedback. All of these options will be implemented to allow students, raters, 
and administrators to access them via any device that has a modern web browser, 
such as smartphones, laptops, and desktop computers.

Purpose
-------
The purpose of the software requirements document is to create a comprehensive outline of the
Clinical Competency Calculator (CCC) for the development team, project advisors, faculty advisors,
stakeholders, and members of the Hershey Medical team that will be maintaining this software. This
outline will describe the functions and high-level requirements of the CCC. The target audience is
expected to know technical terminology related to software development.

Scope
-----
This document specifies the CCC as software designed to be used for the appraisal of students
undergoing clerkship at Hershey Medical, as is to be utilized by the Department of Family Medicine.
The CCC will provide a means of collecting feedback from raters on the competencies of students
and performing useful, actionable analyses thereon. The CCC is not designed to interface with
existing Hershey Medical systems or engage in information exchange therewith. The CCC is also
not designed for utilization by other departments within Hershey Medical; should this software be
used outside of the stated scope, further requirement elicitation should be carried out and relevant
issues addressed.
