Welcome to CCC's documentation!
===================================

The **CCC** is a grading tool to be used to assess the competencies of students
undergoing clerkship at Hershey Medical Center. The CCC aims to replace and
improve upon the preexisting method of collecting feedback from raters by
aggregating more useful feedback and providing more insightful analyses.
Via this system, *students* and *administrators* will have the ability to review
student performance as reported by *raters*. *Administrators* will also be able to
filter low-quality feedback. All of these options will be implemented to allow
students, raters, and administrators to access them via any device that has a
modern web browser, such as smartphones, laptops, and desktop computers.
